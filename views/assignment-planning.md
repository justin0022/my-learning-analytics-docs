# Assignment Planning
## View your progress & upcoming assignments & set goals
![Assignment Planning view](../_assets/MyLA_AssignmentPlanningOverview.png)

The Assignment Planning page shows two different assignment visualizations:

**Minimum Goal and Grade Progress**: At the top of the page you can set a minimum course goal and view a bar showing your current grade, maximum possible grade, and minimum goal grade.

**Assignments by Due Date**: View upcoming and past assignments by week. For each assignment, you can see when it's due, how much it figures into your final grade, and your grade (for graded assignments).

**NOTE**: Only assignments that show up in your Canvas course appear in the visualizations.

## Minimum Goal
**Using My Minimum Goal (%)**

* Set a minimum course goal as a percentage by typing in a number or using the up/down arrows in the text box. When you do this, youâ€™ll see your goal show up on the Grade Progress bar. MyLA will also calculate the grades you need to get on all ungraded assignments to meet that goal.
* Use the Clear button to remove the course goal and all assignment goals.
